# About this Project 
This is the front end repo for my portfolio page. It contains information about my past work
experience and links to various projects I've worked on. Features multiple themes, as well as 
a responsive layout depending on desktop or mobile. The Desktop layout uses dynamically 
positioned title and detail cards that are linked together, with dynamic closing/opening animations.
The mobile layout uses a more straightforward vertical accordian style series of cards.
